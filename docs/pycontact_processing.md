# Note

Since KIF V. 0.2 the module pycontact_processing is no longer required. 

PyContact (which this module was responsible for postprocessing the results of) is an external dependancy and no longer actively maintained. KIF now has the ability to find all contacts in the same manner as PyContact can. This is done through the contact_identification module instead. 

Documentation for the pycontact_processing module is below.
